// Your challenge is to modify the code presented to have the strstr() function continue to search the given string. 
// Remember, the value the function returns is an offset (pointer) into the string where the first match is found. 
// Itâ€™s possible to call the function a second time to continue the search
// I had to look at the solution for this one!
